## State of the Tech Industry in 2023

I got laid off in November. I've been interviewing with a few companies, but I haven't gotten any offers yet. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, or if it's just the market. I'm not sure if I should keep looking, or if I should just take a break.
I think the market will improve in 2023, but near the end of the year. I'm pretty far along in the interview process with a few companies, so I'm hoping I'll get an offer soon. 
Don't give up hope, and keep looking. I'm sure I will find something soon.
